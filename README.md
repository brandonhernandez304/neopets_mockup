# Neopets!

## **Welcome to my Neopets Mock-up** ##

For this app, I dove into django and brought out just a bit of my childhood memories playing neopets many years ago. In the original Neopets, you collect your neopets and play games with them, go on adventures, feed them and play with them like any other real pet, all from the browser of your computer. I replicated just a small fraction of that here with the ability to add neopets to your collection, give them toys to play with, and adding meals to feed them from a calander to know when they ate last.
